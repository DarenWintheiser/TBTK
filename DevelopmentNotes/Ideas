- Make SingleParticleContext contain a Geometry instead of a pointer to a
  Geometry. This should remove the need for copy and move constructors,
  destructor, and assignment and move assignment operators.

- Make Model inherit from SingleParticleContext and ManyBodyContext. Update:
  Probably it is better to replace pointers by member objects instead of
  inheriting.

- Make Geometry use an IndexedDataTree to store the coordinates and specifiers
  to avoid the requirement that a HoppingAmplitudeSet has been constructed
  before the Geometry can be created and set up.

- Make the SingleParticleContext contain an IndexTree that is used to perform
  the mapping between physical and Hilbert space indices to reduce the
  responsibility of the HoppingAmplitudeTree/HoppingAmplitudeSet to that solely
  related to the HoppingAmplitudes.
