- Make SingleParticleContext inherit from HoppingAmplitudeSet and Geometry.

- Make Model inherit from SingleParticleContext and ManyBodyContext.

- Make Geometry use an IndexedDataTree to store the coordinates and specifiers
  to avoid the requirement that a HoppingAmplitudeSet has been constructed
  before the Geometry can be created and set up.

- Make the SingleParticleContext contain an IndexTree that is used to perform
  the mapping between physical and Hilbert space indices to reduce the
  responsibility of the HoppingAmplitudeTree/HoppingAmplitudeSet to that solely
  related to the HoppingAmplitudes.
