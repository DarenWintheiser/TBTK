- Make HoppingAmplitudeSet inherit from the HoppingAmplitudeTree to reduce the
  aparant complexity of the HoppingAmplitudeSet. The HoppingAmplitudeSet
  currently reimplements much of the HoppingAmplitudeTrees interface through
  inline functions that call the corresponding HoppingAmplitudeTree functions.
  Whetherthe inheritance should be private or public depends on whether all of
  the HoppingAmplitudeTrees public functions should be available or not, which
  has to be checked. In case private inheritance is prefered, use "using
  HoppingAmplitudeTree::methodName;" to make specific methods visible through
  the HoppingAmplitudeSet.

- Make SingleParticleContext inherit from HoppingAmplitudeSet and Geometry.

- Make Model inherit from SingleParticleContext and ManyBodyContext.

- Make Geometry use an IndexedDataTree to store the coordinates and specifiers
  to avoid the requirement that a HoppingAmplitudeSet has been constructed
  before the Geometry can be created and set up.

- Make the SingleParticleContext contain an IndexTree that is used to perform
  the mapping between physical and Hilbert space indices to reduce the
  responsibility of the HoppingAmplitudeTree/HoppingAmplitudeSet to that solely
  related to the HoppingAmplitudes.
