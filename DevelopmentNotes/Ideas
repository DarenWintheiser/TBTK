- Make HoppingAmplitudeSet inherit from the HoppingAmplitudeTree to reduce the
  aparant complexity of the HoppingAmplitudeSet. The HoppingAmplitudeSet
  currently reimplements much of the HoppingAmplitudeTrees interface through
  inline functions that call the corresponding HoppingAmplitudeTree functions.
  Whetherthe inheritance should be private or public depends on whether all of
  the HoppingAmplitudeTrees public functions should be available or not, which
  has to be checked. In case private inheritance is prefered, use "using
  HoppingAmplitudeTree::function()" to make specific methods visible through
  the HoppingAmplitudeSet.
