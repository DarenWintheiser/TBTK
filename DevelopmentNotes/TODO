- Rename HoppingAmplitudeSet::addHoppingAmplitude() to
  HoppingAmpliutdeSet::add().

- Remove responsibility to store the Hamiltonian on the COO sparse matrix
  format from the HoppingAMplitudeSet. Likely solution: Make the
  HoppingAmplitudeTree or HoppingAMplitudeSet responsible for on the demand
  constructing and returning a SparseMatrix. The HoppingAmplitudeTree is
  complex in itself, and probably it is therefore better to let the
  HoppingAmplitudeSet take on this responsibility. This should also result in
  the copy and move constructors, destructor and assignment and move assignment
  operators to no longer be needed.

- Rename HoppingAmplitudeTree::getHAs() and HoppingAmplitudeSet::getHAs() to
  ::getHoppingAmplitudes(). Also make these functions return constant
  references rather than pointers to constants.

- Rewrite HoppingAmplitudeTree::Iterator and HoppingAmplitudeSet::Iterator to
  use standard iterator notation with operator++(), operator*(), operator==(),
  and operator!=().
