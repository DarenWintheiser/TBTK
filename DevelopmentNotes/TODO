- Implement support for serialization for all primitive data types,
  Serializable, and pseudo-Serializable classes.

- Review the design of AbstractProperty. The class currently probably exposes
  too much of its internal structure and also requires the user to be aware of
  the IndexDescriptor when creating new AbstractProperties using the enum class
  IndexDescriptor::Format..

- Add serialization for Property::GreensFunction.

- Remove variables such as hint and energies from the PropertyExtractors that
  are used to communicate information between the calculateXXX-functions and
  the XXXCallback-functions. Instead pass a hint parameter as argument through
  the calculate() and callback functions. This will allow the same
  PropertyExtractor to be parallelized as long as the solver allows for this.

- Implement operator+=(), operator-=(), operator*=(), operator/=() operator+(),
  operator-(), opeartor*(), and operator/() for all Properties.

- Add operator+(), operator-(), operator++(), operator--(), operator*(), and
  operator/() to Subindex.
