- Remove responsibility to store the Hamiltonian on the COO sparse matrix
  format from the HoppingAmplitudeSet. Likely solution: Make the
  HoppingAmplitudeTree or HoppingAmplitudeSet responsible for on the demand
  constructing and returning a SparseMatrix. The HoppingAmplitudeTree is
  complex in itself, and probably it is therefore better to let the
  HoppingAmplitudeSet take on this responsibility. This should also result in
  the copy and move constructors, destructor and assignment and move assignment
  operators to no longer be needed. Further, this removes the need on the
  Solver::ChebyshevExpander to override the metodh Solver::setSolver().

- Rewrite HoppingAmplitudeTree::Iterator, HoppingAmplitudeSet::Iterator and
  IndexTree::Iterator to use standard iterator notation with operator++(),
  operator*(), operator==(), and operator!=().

- Rename ManyBodyContext (etc) to ManyParticleContext (etc).

- The BlockDiagonalizer does not work for Models with a single global block.
  Fix the BlockDiagonalizer so that it does not crash when using for example
  the Model generated by "model << HoppingAmplitude(1, {1}, {0}) + HC".

- Make ArnoldiIterator::setCentralValue() affect also the calculations
  performed in Mode::Normal.
