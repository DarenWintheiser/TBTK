/** @brief Adds a header and footer to the output.
 *
 *  This class is meant to be instantiated as a global variable to print the
 *  given string before and after the output written to stdout. This allows for
 *  formating string required by Doxygen to be written without the code for
 *  doing so being included in the example. The intended usage is as follows:
 *
 *  #include "HeaderAndFooter.h"
 *  TBTK::DocumentationExamples::HeaderAndFooter("//! [ExampleName]")
 *
 *  //! [ExampleName]
 *  #include "TBTK/Index.h"
 *  #include "TBTK/Streams.h"
 *
 *  using namespace TBTK;
 *
 *  int main(){
 *    Index index({1, 2, 3});
 *    for(unsigned int n = 0; n < index.getSize(); n++)
 *      Streams::out << index[n] << "\n";
 *  }
 *  //! [ExampleName]
 *
 *  With this structure, doxygen will be able to extract the code snippet
 *  between the two comments. At the same time, the output will have the form
 *  //! [ExampleName]
 *  0
 *  1
 *  2
 *  //! [ExampleName]
 *  where the first and last lines have been added by HeaderAndFooter. This
 *  way, doxygen is able to extract both the output and code used to generate
 *  the output in the same way. */
